Introduction
============

Time Keep is a simple productivity notification icon inspired by a tip I heard
long ago, and tomate (https://gitorious.org/tomate).

The idea is as follows: even when you are focused on your work, there can be some
distractions that you might not be aware of. One question leads to another and before
you know it you've spent half an hour reading related matters, completely disregarding
what you were working on before. To help you with this, you can use a bell that rings
at set intervals to remind you to go back to work. We all have different attention 
spans, and also, if the bell rings too often, you are prone to ignore it as well. It
should ring often enough to kill distractions, but sparsely enough not to be expected.
It is also good to be able to set the working time, so that the bell doesn't ring when
you don't need it to.

When you run the application, you will get a bell in your system tray. You can click
to toggle it, and right click it to set the time intervals, beginning and ending hour.
There are three states: empty bell (off), full bell (on), and crossed bell (sleeping).

Running and installing
======================

To run the applet, simply launch timekeep.py: ./timekeep.py.

You can also install it globably on your system using the provided install
script. The command to launch is then "timekeep" (without the .py).

If you like it, I would suggest adding it to the startup applications of your desktop
environment.
